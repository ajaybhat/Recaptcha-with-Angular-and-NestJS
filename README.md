# Recaptcha-with-Angular-and-NestJS

To run backend (NestJS):

`npm run start`

To run frontend (Angular):

`cd frontend; npm run start;`

Site and secret keys are already configured for the backend and frontend, so you can run the applications as-is.

Note: In order to login, use `admin/admin`. Only these credentials are supported for now.
